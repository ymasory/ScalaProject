=============
Scala Project
=============

Purpose
=======
This project is a "dummy" Scala project you can use as a starting point for your Scala project. It includes the Scala library and is already integrated with Ant and ScalaTest. You *do* need Ant and Java 5+ installed and available at the command line. You do *not* need Scala or ScalaTest. It is already provided and configured.

Getting Started
===============
`cd ScalaProject`
`ant build` #compiles Scala project and tests
`ant test`  #runs unit tests
`ant run`   #runs Scala project

Now fill in your own code and tests!

How Can I Help?
===============
I created this project because I had many problems getting Scala integrated with ScalaTest and Ant. Some of the documentation out there is wrong or out of date. You can contribute back by improving the provided build.xml. I'm no Ant expert. Also, you might consider making a similar Scala dummy project for other build automation systems.
